Hello!
I have created a website with an interface that encrypts and decrypts texts. To use it, simply enter the text in the box labeled "Enter your text here" and select the desired option (decrypt or encrypt) using the buttons. Additionally, there is a copy button for the output text.
For use it you should download the folder and open the file compatible with your browser.

I invite you to decrypt the following message:
"hoberlai, mimes nobermbrenter enters caimimeslai y enterstai enters mimes primesmenterrai paigimesnai wenterb entern 
lai quenter puenterdenters enterncrimesptair ober dentersenterncrimesptair tenterxtobers"

Regards.
